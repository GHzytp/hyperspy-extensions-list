# (Known) HyperSpy extensions

HyperSpy extensions are packages that use the hyperspy extension mechanism to add functionality to HyperSpy (such as GUI widgets) and/or register new subclasses of HyperSpy objects (such as components and signals).

The following is a non-exhaustive list of HyperSpy extensions. If you would
like to add your package here, just [follow these
instructions](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-extensions-list/blob/make_readme/doc/how_to_add_extension.md)
and send us a pull request or just [open an
issue](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-extensions-list/issues) with the
request and we'll get it done for you.
